### Welcome to my Digital Garden
[This page](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) on Ness Labs succinctly summarizes what a "Digital Garden" is
> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

I've always struggled with *what* to take notes in. I landed on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) a while back, and have been slowly building out my personal notebook. It's not perfect by any means, but it is straightforward, and the notes are just Markdown.
